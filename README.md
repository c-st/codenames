# Codenames

> Codenames is a word association game for two teams, each led by a spymaster. The spymasters give one-word clues and a number, guiding their teammates to guess specific words from a shared grid. Teams aim to identify their own words while avoiding the opponentâ€™s, neutral words, and the deadly assassin word, which ends the game immediately if guessed. The first team to identify all their words wins.
